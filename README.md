# Dijkstra Link-State Algorithm

This project implements the Dijkstra Link-State Algorithm to compute the shortest paths and forwarding tables for a network graph. It uses Python's `networkx` library for graph representation and `matplotlib` for visualization.

## Features

- Create a graph from user input.
- Visualize the graph topology.
- Compute shortest paths using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Generate and display forwarding tables for all nodes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `networkx` library
- `matplotlib` library


Usage
Run the program:

Follow the prompts to input the number of nodes, edges, and their weights.

View the graph visualization and forwarding tables for all nodes.
